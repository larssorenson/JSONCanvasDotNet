# JSON Canvas Dot Net
This project provides a library for creating and interacting with spec-compliant [JSON Canvas](https://jsoncanvas.org/).

Currently, the project only allows creating a Canvas with Nodes and Edges as .NET objects to work with .NET's JSON Serialization libraries.
The various object models also support various utility functions to assist in programmatically creating canvases, ranging from simple overlapping nodes to determining the best edge to connect two nodes on.

Future improvements include loading and parsing JSON Canvases and programmatic tiling a canvas with nodes/edges.
