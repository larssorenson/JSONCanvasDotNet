# JSON Canvas Dot Net
This project provides a library for creating and interacting with spec-compliant [JSON Canvas](https://jsoncanvas.org/).

Currently, the library allows for creating Canvases, Nodes, and Edges as .NET objects through .NET's JSON Serialization libraries, and outputting valid JSON Canvas JSON representations.

The various object models also support various utility functions to assist in programmatically creating canvases, ranging from simple overlapping nodes to determining the best edge to connect two nodes on.

The library does not yet support loading existing JSON Canvases.
